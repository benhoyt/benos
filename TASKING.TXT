BenOS v1.0 multitasking routines (c) Benjamin Hoyt 1998

A tid or "task identifcation cell" is the memory address of a task's
user variable table. This has in it the necessary things for every
task: the data and return stack pointers and sizes, pointers to the
next and previous tasks, and all the other user variables.

Use start-task stop-task and sleep to handle multitasking. start-task
takes an execution token and stack sizes, creates the task stacks and
user variables, and adds the task to the task list, returning a tid
cell. The execution token given to start-task is the word which will
be executed when the task is started. If this word ever returns (with
exit or ;) the task will be stopped as with stop-task. stop-task
removes the task from the task list and frees up memory used by the
task. sleep is a major part of the cooperative multitasking idea: it
switches from the current task to the next one in the list.
