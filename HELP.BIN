BenOS v1.0 Forth and OS kernel (c) Benjamin Hoyt 1998

BenOS, a hobbyist project, is a small Forth operating system. BenOS
(because it's Forth) uses Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), so operands
come before operations. "0 LIST" will list block zero, 0 pushing the
number zero onto the stack and LIST displaying it's contents. A few
commands are listed below:

command    stack effect       example     description
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
help       --                 help        display a brief help page
reboot     --                 reboot      reboot the system
list       block --           4 list      display a block
edit       block --           1 edit      edit a block
+          n1 n2 -- sum       3 4 +       add n1 and n2 giving sum (7)
.          n --               5 6 * .     display a number (30)

Note: EDIT invokes the block editor, the code for which is not yet
      loaded. Type "4 12 thru" to load the editor.

Try: "status on" to turn on the top-of-screen status line, or
     "13 14 thru eat" for a little demo, "full" to stop it
